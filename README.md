Writing social media app for bookworms in go (backend) and typescript (react) frontend. Minimal use of AI assistants and no copy-paste-coding to preserve control of codebase.

To run the app, execute <br> <br>
`docker compose up` <br> <br> While standing in the root folder. This will:
* Build and run three Docker containers: mysql (DB), backend, and frontend
* Create database and initialize its schemas
* Build and run backend
* Install and run frontend

Then visit the frontend by navigating to http://localhost:3000/
